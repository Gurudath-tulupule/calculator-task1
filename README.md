# Simple Calculator Application

## Objective
To develop a Java-based calculator application using Swing that performs basic arithmetic operations with a clean and responsive graphical user interface.

## Overview
This is a simple calculator application built with Java Swing. The application provides functionality for basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a grid-based layout for buttons and an intuitive display for input and results. Error handling is implemented for scenarios like division by zero or invalid input.

### Features:
- User-friendly interface with a responsive design.
- Supports numeric input and basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- "C" button to clear the display and reset the calculator.
- "=" button to display the result of operations.
- Error handling for invalid inputs or division by zero.

This project showcases the integration of Java Swing components with event handling, making it ideal for understanding GUI programming in Java.
